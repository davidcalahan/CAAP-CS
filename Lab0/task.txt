'tamales deliciosos' was my added content
In order to find it after I added it I googled 'how to show recently changes in git' and found a this source 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12359504/get-last-changes-of-file-with-git' which suggested that I use the command git diff
Once I used that command I got the following output-warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in Lab0/README.txt.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory
diff --git a/Lab0/README.txt b/Lab0/README.txt
